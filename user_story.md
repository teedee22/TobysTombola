The person running the tournament goes to the website, if no tombola is running they have the option to start one

They opt to start the tombola and enter a time limit

Attempting to access the website while the tombola is in progress takes them to a screen time remaining in which they can enter how many tickets they want to buy

The screen calculates the value of the tickets and displays this next to the input field in realtime - what if someone buys in the meantime?
If the price has gone up since the page load, the page displays an error message and confirms the new price with them.

When they click to buy the tickets, the app sends back their ticket IDs and their current odds of winning

At the end of the timer, the page refreshes and displays the ID of the winning ticket

The api quotes the price for number of tickets
The api receives number of tickets someone wishes to buy and returns the odds of them winning based on the current number of people in the game.
